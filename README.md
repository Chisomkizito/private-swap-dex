# private-swap-dex
A Private Swap DEX on Avalanche using eERC20 tokens and ZK proofs.
🔒 Private Swap DEX

A decentralized exchange built on Avalanche where token swaps remain private and confidential using encrypted ERC20 tokens (eERC20) and zero-knowledge proofs.

🚀 Mission

Reimagine decentralized finance with privacy at the core, enabling confidential swaps, lending, staking, and DAO mechanisms.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React / Next.js, Tailwind CSS, RainbowKit, Wagmi, Ethers.js

Backend (optional): Node.js, Express.js

Blockchain: Avalanche C-Chain / Subnets, Solidity, Hardhat

Privacy Layer: eERC20, zk-SNARKs (Circom, snark.js)

Integrations: Core Wallet, MetaMask, WalletConnect, Chainlink Oracles, IPFS

📦 Features (MVP)

Deploy and mint eERC20 tokens on Avalanche Fuji Testnet

Wallet connection (Core Wallet / MetaMask)

Private token swaps (encrypted amounts)

Clean UI for easy demo

⚡ Roadmap (Hackathon Timeline)

Day 1 (Today):

Repo setup, frontend boilerplate, wallet connect, deploy eERC20 token

Day 2:

Build swap smart contract, integrate with frontend

Day 3:

Test end-to-end flow (mint → swap → balance update)

Day 4:

UI polish, branding, documentation

Day 5 (Submission):

Final testing, deploy frontend, submit demo
